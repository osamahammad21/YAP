# YAP+
- YAP+ is a Python-based yield modeling and simulation tool for advanced packaging that supports yield analysis of arbitrary I/O pad layouts. Currently, the model is specifically designed for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding.
- A [GUI of YAP](http://nanocad.ee.ucla.edu:8081/yap_gui/) and the [user guide video](https://youtu.be/8hiKIQ6C7ng) is available.

# Usage
- Run the simulator and model for W2W hybrid bonding.
  ```
  cd W2W
  ```
  Modify `configs/config.yaml` to update modeling or simulation configurations.
  Execute the `simulator_main.ipynb` for the simulation and `calculator_main.ipynb` for the modeling.
- Run the simulator and model for D2W hybrid bonding.
  ```
  cd D2W
  ```
  Modify `configs/config.yaml` to update modeling or simulation configurations.
  Execute the `simulator_main.ipynb` for the simulation and `calculator_main.ipynb` for the modeling.
